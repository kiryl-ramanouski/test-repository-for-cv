**My goal** is to become professional front-end developer. I wish to work in great team and develop powerful features.
I like learning things. I always was a good student in university and I’m really good at finding and using information. I was born and live in Minsk, but I’m ready to move.

**I have some good dev. experience from my university:**
Educational establishment: Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics.
Faculty: Faculty of Computer Systems and Networks
Department: Electronic computing machines
Degree information: Graduate (master)

**I get some good experience from education sites like:**

1. Codewars.com:

2. Htmlacademy.ru:

I have some skills at CSS, HTML and JS. I know basics of Java, C/C++ and OOP.

Code example:

```
/* The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a
string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}. */

function count (string) {
  let result = {};
  let lettersArray = string.split('');
  for (let i = 0; i < lettersArray.length; i++) {
    let count = result[lettersArray[i]]? result[lettersArray[i]] : 0;
    result[lettersArray[i]] = count + 1;
  }
  return result;
}
```

**My English level** is pre-intermediate. And it is intermediate in some cases for example in reading and listening. I’ve been taking private lessons since May 2019 and I watch films and TV series in English.
