**My goal** is to become professional front-end developer. I wish to work in great team and develop powerful features.
I like learning things. I always was a good student in university and I’m really good at finding and using information. I was born and live in Minsk, but I’m ready to move.

**I have some good dev. experience from my university:**
Educational establishment: Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics.
Faculty: Faculty of Computer Systems and Networks
Department: Electronic computing machines
Degree information: Graduate (master)

**I get some good experience from education sites like:**

- htmlacademy.ru*Tabspace*[my Htmlacademy Profile](https://htmlacademy.ru/profile/whitekvazar)

I have some skills at CSS, HTML and JS. I know basics of Java, C/C++ and OOP.

Code example:

```
const func = (num) => {
  if (num > 0) {
    return num - 1;
  }
  return num + 1;
};
```

**My English level** is pre-intermediate. And it is intermediate in some cases for example in reading and listening. I’ve been taking private lessons since May 2019 and I watch films and TV series in English.
